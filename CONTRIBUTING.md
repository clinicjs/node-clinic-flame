# Contributing to Clinic.js

The Clinic.js project welcomes all contributions from anyone willing to
work in good faith with other contributors and the community. No contribution
is too small and all contributions are valued.

## Code of Conduct

The Clinic.js project has a [Code of Conduct][CoC] that all contributors are
expected to follow.

## Licensing and Certification

While the Clinic.js project as a whole is distributed under the GPL 3.0
license, all contributions to the Clinic.js project are submitted *to* the
project under the MIT license. This gives the project maintainers flexibility
while ensuring that your rights to your contributions do not change.

The Clinic.js project uses a Contribution Certification that is derived from
the [Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO]. It is important to note that the
Contribution Certification *is not the same as the standard DCO* and we do not
use the term "DCO" or "Developer Certificate of Origin" to describe it to avoid
confusion. Nevertheless, the intent and purpose is effectively the same.

Every contributor agrees to the Contribution Certification by including a
`Signed-off-by` statement within each commit. The statement *must* include
the contributor's real full name and email address.

```
Signed-off-by: J. Random User <j.random.user@example.com>
```

### Certification

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right
to and hereby submit it under the MIT license; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the
right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created
in whole or in part by me, under the MIT License; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public
and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I
submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
redistributed consistent with this project or license(s) involved.
