# Contributing to Clinic.js

The Clinic.js project welcomes all contributions from anyone willing to
work in good faith with other contributors and the community. No contribution
is too small and all contributions are valued.

## Code of Conduct

The Clinic.js project has a [Code of Conduct][CoC] that all contributors are
expected to follow.

## Licensing and Certification

All contributions to the Clinic.js project are submitted to the
project under the MIT license.

The Clinic.js project uses a Contribution Certification that is derived from
the [Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO]. It is important to note that the
Contribution Certification *is not the same as the standard DCO* and we do not
use the term "DCO" or "Developer Certificate of Origin" to describe it to avoid
confusion. Nevertheless, the intent and purpose is effectively the same.

Every contributor agrees to the Contribution Certification by including a
`Signed-off-by` statement within each commit. The statement *must* include
the contributor's real full name and email address.

```
Signed-off-by: J. Random User <j.random.user@example.com>
```

knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

redistributed consistent with this project or license(s) involved.
