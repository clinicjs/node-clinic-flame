      <p>This is a Flamegraph. Each block represents the time spent executing calls to a function. The wider the block, the more time was spent.</p>
      <p>Blocks sit on the function that called them, so the stack below each block shows its stack trace.</p>

      <p>This might signify a problem: for example, it might be a slow function that can be optimised, or that is called very many times by functions below it.</p>
